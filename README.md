- 👋 Hi, I’m @B-Crough
- 👀 I’m interested in soccer, swimming, gaming on my xbox, chillin on YouTube, learning to code, and boosting my resume for a career in IT
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ at a very snail-like pace, but eventually want to learn more about java, python, C, html, and other coding languages
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any beginner programs/projects that can better teach myself as well as others wanting to "learn to code"
- 📫 How to reach me: If there is a messaging system on here, use that.  Otherwise you can find me on LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/bcrough/
